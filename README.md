## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- There is a **positive but nonlinear** relationship between discount rate and conversion rate.
- After removing extreme outliers, **conversion rates tend to improve** in the moderate discount range of **20â€“35%**.
- Extremely **low or high discounts do not guarantee better conversions**.
- **Product categories respond differently** to discounts. For example, `Storage` and `Accessories` see higher responsiveness.
- **Cleaning outliers** helps avoid misleading results and improves decision-making.
